## Overview
The rules are simple: collect the most pairs of cards before time runs out, winning your turn gives you an extra turn. The NPC logic keeps a history of turns, making it play smart and fair. There's also an option to crank up the NPC's difficulty.

## Run Game
- Install Godot Engine with .NET support installed
- Clone the repository
- Launch Godot and select the project.godot file to open
